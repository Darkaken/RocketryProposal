- Ruins on Earth have been removed
- Prisoners are nerve stapled and genetically altered to become a subservient peasantry to serve the future inhabitants of Earth

#### Things to find:
- More advertisement
- Genetic engineering reports
- Yes villagers are nerve stapled people


### Year -12
- Doctor E. Fowler decides to go on vacation on a relatively untouched planet for his 40th birthday
- Here he discovers an organism, an animal resembling a fleshy plant
- This creature can absorb nutrients directly from the environment
- He finds it can grow root like appendages to reach underground mineral deposits to extract important nutrients
- He has a lab setup on the planet to study The Flesh
- He engineers the Flesh to be hungrier for precious metals and increases its growth rate
- He reports his finds to his employer, BeltCorp, a multispecialised company

#### Things to find:
- Abandoned lab with research notes and data


### Year -11
- The Flesh is deployed for asteroid mining, used on targets that would be uneconomical with conventional methods
- Flesh use is now being tested in the system it was discovered in only
- It is very effective and BeltCopr decides to use it on all of their asteroids in multiple systems
- The Flesh consumes a technician that accidentally makes contact with it
- Multisystem deployment is delayed to study the new behaviour of the Flesh
- 12 of the best scientists and bioengineers from the company are given the best technology to study it
- They find it has a taste for living things, especially ones with central nervous systems
- They discover that abosrbed animals have their entire body converted to Flesh, except their brain
- Victims are still concious and perfectly aware of everything, even if they are just brains now
- They discover the Flesh keeps the brains alive for computational power and accessing memories
- They try to communicate with it by feeding it monkeys trained in sign language
- This fails and they find that the memory of being absorbed is erased, as it would be too traumatic for the Flesh
- They keep experimenting by feeding it live rats
- Two rats die because of a fire caused by a chemical leak and they decide to feed it the corpses anyway
- To their surprise the Flesh consumes the bodies and reanimates the brains of the deceased rats
- It can do this to any fresh enough corpse
- The Flesh now seems to be scared of the smell of the chemicals that caused the fire
- They deduce the Flesh has now gained the memory of the dead rats, it remembers dying
- Reanimating a dead corpse bypasses the memory erasure protection, allowing it to retain all memories
- They find this extremely fascinating and have the company send them the most advanced technology available
- Wetware biointerface arrives to connect a computer to the Flesh, to read its memories of death
- The Flesh uses the knowledge of the technitian to escape by disabling the lab systems
- The researchers manage to lock themselves in another wing of the lab, but have no way out
- One of them uses a sleeping agent to knock the others out
- He brutally tortures all of them to death, one by one, in the most excruciating way possible
- He sets up a timer for the door separating them from the flesh and tortures himself to death too
- His logic being that when the Flesh absorbs their bodies it will be overwhelmed by the intense pain
- This does not work, the Flesh is now a living hell
- Victims are forced to feel the pain and terror of torture and death for eternity
- The Flesh takes control of the lab lifeboats, using the wetware tech to interface with its systems
- It uses the ships to fly out, to grow (this is very close to the end of the year)

#### Things to find:
- The lab where it all went down
- Crashed lifeboats on planets targeted by the Flesh
- Last message sent by a colonist to his son, just before the Flesh attacked his home


### Year -10
- The Interplanetary Federation is now fighting the Flesh
- It has devolved into a hypermilitaristic society
- Infected colonies and ships are instantly nuked
- Most people who do not participate in military service perceive the Flesh as a distant and vague threat
- The fighting is continuous, it never ceases
- They find the only way to effectively counter the Flesh is with disintegrators or fire
- They fortify the otherwise unhinabited moons around their planets and fill them with heavy artillery
- The outermost colonies are left to fend for themselves and soon get absorbed by the Flesh

#### Things to find:
- Battle reports
- Military propaganda
- Debates about wether colonies should be helped or not
- Debris from the battles


### Year -9
- The decision to mine resources on Earth is taken, so far it was avoided earlier due to the danger of the old bioweapons
- Huge mining systems are deployed to directly mine the core, sustained by prison labour

#### Things to find:
- Mining pillars on Earth


### Year -7
- The war ends in favour of the Federation, which manages to confine the Flesh to its original planet
- The planet's moon is converted into a military and research outpost, to contain and study the Flesh
- The Flesh completely consumes the planet's biosphere, the planet is now named Morbus
- The moon is renamed to Custos
- A mistake with a stargate connection being deployed between the homeworld and Custos opens a connection to an unknown gate on Morbus
- Military leaders are absorbed and used to open the gate back to the homeworld
- The largest and most protected planet in the Federation is taken over by the Flesh
- This causes the Interplanetary Federation to immediately collapse
- Mass suicides begin, to avoid being absorbed
- Some use cybernetic tech to convert themselves into wetware-incompatible cyborgs to avoid absorption
- The flesh spreads out to consume the last remnants of humanity
- Earth is left untouched by it as it always had bigger targets

#### Things to find:
- Ruins of the Stargates
- Abandoned Custos outpost
- What remains of the homeworld


### Year -6
- The last remant of humanity finds out the true origin of the Flesh
- It was originally even more nightmareish than what they face now
- It was nearly destroyed in a fight with an immensely powerful race
- This race didn't want to make it extinct, so they engineered it into a more peaceful form
- Fowler accidentally disabled those changes when he engineered it to be more efficient for resource extraction
- This new information is not of much use though, the last outpost is attacked and the last researchers are absorbed

#### Things to find:
- The last outpost


### Year -5
- The end of the war makes the flesh dormant again, as most large human groups have been absorbed, the remaining ones trying to flee the former federation space

#### Things to find:
- The remaining human groups being very scattered and hostile


### Year 0
- An individual of great technical knowledge starts interacting with one of the human groups, showing interest in studying the flesh to determine the degree to which it was altered
- This individual starts being hunted by the other groups, who eventually corner the group that intended to study the flesh
- The fighting and increased human activity re-awakens the flesh
- After an ambush the transport ship taking them to custos is forced to drop the individual on Earth to allow them to escape the pursuers. This is done using a prisoner drop pod, as the transport ship is one that was used to drop off prison labour on Earth and still has a functional pod
- Player is left on Earth, with a memory wipe, but retaining part of that technical knowledge
- The Flesh starts to send its seed ships out into unknown regions of space, chasing prey

#### Things to find:
- Capsule the player was sent to Earth with
- Surival guide from whoever dropped off the player
- Radar logs showing corrupted transponder signals of Flesh ships moving out

## Characters

### The Flesh

#### Description
An incredibly adaptive and resistant lifeform, it lacks any recognisable structure. It is basically a disordered pile of proteins and other molecules each with a very specific task. It does however contain what could be considered an equivalent of DNA, a series of proteins that instructs various pieces of it on how to behave. Some of the proteins can form long chains capable of transmitting electrical signals, forming what could be considered a nervous system.
The Flesh is capable of synthetising any substance that can be made with the elements contained within the Flesh itself. This gives it the ability to chemically attack and digest almost any substance. It mostly uses this ability to hunt other lifeforms as food, this is most likely because of the highly energetic chemical compounds contained in living beings. The digestion ability is also selective, it can choose to only dissolve some parts of a target, leaving the other untouched. It has been observed that the Flesh will not dissolve the central nervous system of intelligent animals, it will instead keep those parts alive to use as sources of information and processing power. The flesh-like appeare of the Flesh is to be attributed to the flexibility and richness of carbon chemistry, and on the high availability of iron in the environment.
To completely take over another organism, a certain critical mass of Flesh is required. A piece of Flesh that is less than 1/50.000 times the mass of its target will not be able to completely dissolve and assimilate it. However, as long as it is more than 1/50.000.000 times the mass of its target it will be able to modify its biochemistry and phisionomy, turning it into an effective fighting machine and infection vector. 
The Flesh only wants to consume.

#### Locations
- Morbus
- Homeworld

#### Strengths
- Nearly immune to most forms of damage, due to its lack of internal structure
- Can adapt to survive in almost all environments, including the vacuum of space
- Can absorb any form of life
- Can interface with the most advanced Interplanetary Federation technology
- Is now very intelligent thanks to the amount of brains it absorbed

#### Weaknesses
- High temperature destroys its chemistry, low temperature halts it temporarely
- Radiation

## Locations

### Celestial bodies

#### Mercury
- Surface gravity: 0.38g
- Day length: 88 Earth Days
- Atmosphere: None
- Orbital period: 59 Earth Days
- Orbits: Sol
- Satellites: None
- Rare resources: None

The closest planet to the Sun, very metal rich. There are mining outposts at the poles where some craters and mountains provide permanent shade. The mining outposts were abandoned after the fall of the Republic as companies in the Federation deemed them unprofitable, only to be reopened after the resource scarcity began. As soon as news of the fall of the Federation reached Mercury the people working there loaded a cargo ship with all the supplies they could carry and escaped towards an uncharted region of space.

#### Venus
- Surface gravity: 0.9g
- Day length: 117 Earth Days
- Atmosphere: Unbreathable (92 atm)
    1. 96.5% Carbon Dioxide
    2. 3.5% Nitrogen
    3. 0.015% Sulfur Dioxide
    4. 0.007% Argon
    5. 0.002% Water Vapor
    6. 0.0017% Carbon Monoxide
    7. 0.0012% Helium
    8. 0.0007% Neon
- Orbital period: 225 Earth Days
- Orbits: Sol
- Satellites: None
- Rare resources: None

The planet has always been too hostile for any permanent presence, only very few of the richest people in the Federation could afford to have permanent residences built underneat the surface as survival shelters. Ultimately they were of little use to them, after the Flesh was contained they returned to their mansions, only to have the Flesh breach containment. The homeworld was taken over too quickly for them to leave. These advanced bunkers now sit empty, the automated systems keep them running but they won't last long without proper maintenance, some already failed.  

#### Earth
- Surface gravity: 1g
- Day length: 24.000 ticks
- Atmosphere: Breathable (1 atm)
    1. 78.084% Nitrogen
    2. 20.946% Oxygen
    3. 0.9340% Argon
    4. 0.0417% Carbon Dioxide
    5. 0.001818% Neon
    6. 0.000524% Helium
    7. 0.000187% Methane
    8. 0.000114% Krypton
- Orbital period: 365 Earth Days
- Orbits: Sol
- Satellites:
    1. Moon
- Rare resources: None

Once a powerful republic, now barely anything remains, the world has been mostly reclaimed by nature, some groups using old world technology are still active. One of the weapons used in the war that followed the collapse of the republic was a bioweapon capable of turning people into zombies, which are now the main hostile creature found on the planet. Zombies are fast and strong, but a shotgun blast can easily take them down, they only come out at night. The player is left here after a memory wipe, the spawn location has the pleyer's drop pod with a message for the inmate, warning about the dangers of the world. 

#### Moon
- Surface gravity: 0.166g
- Day length: 30 Earth Days
- Atmosphere: None
- Orbital period: 30 Earth Days
- Orbits: Earth
- Satellites: None
- Rare resources: None

The only natural satellite of Earth, it was by the republic both as a gateway to the stars and as a defense platform. It decalred independence after the fall of the republic but couldn't sustain itself after the war, people who could afford it moved to the Interplanetary Federation. The rest died in the Moon skirmishes or because of equipment breakdown over prolonged periods without proper maintenance. All is left are empty bases and infrastructure.

#### Mars
- Surface gravity: 0.38g
- Day length: 1.02749125 Earth Days
- Atmosphere: Unbreathable (0.00628 atm)
    1. 95.97% Carbon Dioxide
    2. 1.93% Argon
    3. 1.89% Nitrogen
    4. 0.146% Oxygen
    5. 0.0557% Carbon Monoxide
    6. 0.021% Water Vapor
- Orbital period: 687 Earth Days
- Orbits: Sol
- Satellites:
    1. Phobos
    2. Deimos
- Rare resources:
    - Dilithium

The red planet, the first planet to be colonised by humans. Most colonies were abandoned after the first warp capable ships reached habitable planets in other star systems. Little remains on the old colonies, mostly buried in the martian sand. The planet is inhospitable but peaceful. Dilithium can be found on Mars, making this a strategically important planet for both the Republic and the Interstellar Federation. The mining facilities of the Republic were kept active even after it fell, under the Federation. Because of its importance, the Earth stargate was moved to Mars after the fall of the Republic. This was done by the Federation attacking and bombing one of the newly formed nation states, consequence of this is that even after the collapse of civilisation on Earth some local factions still hate the Federation and will be hostile towards any Federation citizen.

## Technologies

### Warp Drive
Consumes a lot of power to move a ship by contracting/exapnding spacetime around it. Most warp drives exploit the proprties of dilithium crystals to do this. The most important technology to any faction, without it movement is limited to one system. It is limited to movement to and from sufficiently flat space (it won't work insie a black hole).

### Warp Mail
Signals still travel at light speed, which is not great for interstellar communication. Special capsules, basically just a warp drive, power source, basic flight computer and memory units were designed and built to move data on long distances. A bigger variety of capsule is capable of transporting small mail packages too, but sending physical mail is too expensive for most colonists.

### Wormhole Travel
Allows for near instantaneous travel between any two points in spacetime, extremely advanced, very few civilisations can manage to build even the most basic wormhole transportation systems. The Interplanetary Federation uses existing Stargates to connect the most important planets (or moons). Preventing wormholes from being created is an extremely difficult task, considered impossible by most civilisations.
