# Read this first

This was made to organize the important ideas and information surrounding supersymmetry as I noticed that a lot of useful information got forgotten as a result of being buried on discord, or being put on sites that people no longer use. Before, ideas were spread all over the place on github, discord, and so on. This repository will be the one dumping ground for ideas where they can be easily tracked and remembered.

To submit an idea: Open an issue. Give it a brief title summarizing the idea. If you can, add details, links, and images for the idea. If you don't have a lot of details about your idea, that's fine. The only thing you have to do is assign categories to the issue so we have a basic idea of what it is (besides the title). Existing ideas can have suggestions added to them in replies.

This place should only be for pending ideas and not for ideas that have already been approved, or ideas that are currently being implemented.
Approved ideas are put in the “Todo” section of the github tracking project. Ideas currently being implemented are put in the “In Planning” category or “In Progress” category on the tracking project. Close issues if they are moved to the github project.
