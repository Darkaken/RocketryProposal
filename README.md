# Read this first

This was made to organize the important ideas and information surrounding supersymmetry as I noticed that a lot of useful information got forgotten as a result of being buried on discord, or being put on sites that people no longer use. Before, ideas were spread all over the place on github, discord, and so on. This document will be the one dumping ground for ideas where they can be easily tracked and remembered.

This document should only be for pending ideas and not for ideas that have already been approved, or ideas that are currently being implemented.
Approved ideas are put in the “Todo” section of the github tracking project. Ideas currently being implemented are put in the “In Planning” category or “In Progress” category on the tracking project. Delete them from this document if they are moved.

Ideas can be added, existing ones can have suggestions added to them, and outdated ones can be deleted. Many ideas here are not well researched and only contain a few wikipedia links. Feel free to add details to them. Don’t use comments to make edits. Edit in the document directly because the comment system is scuffed. You have writing permission.

Simply put your idea in where you think it belongs in this document (theres several sections)
