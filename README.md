Before, in the dark ages, ideas and information were spread all over the place on github and discord. 
But organization will become more important as supersymmetry development becomes more active. This was made to keep track of the ideas and information surrounding supersymmetry, in one place. There is not really a format for submitting ideas.

PLEASE immediately PR / open Issues or DM divine_ray if you have any concerns, ideas or complaints. Don't hesitate, nobody will bite you. 

More information about stuff is in \#important-stuff channel. 
Do not treat discord as platform for organisation. It is a black hole for information which gets lost extremely easy. 
Stuff that is in progress is noted here: https://github.com/orgs/SymmetricDevs/projects/1

# Recent Surge of Activity
I, divine_ray, took over this repo^[under agreement with the remaining team] and managing it using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It appears that i am now in charge of taming and wrangling concepts from all over the entire dev team. *Fun Stuff.* 

# Overall game design

This is just for keeping track of the overall game design of Supersymmetry, according to Zalgo:

Yet we have reached a point in susy-dev where Zalgo is no longer credible as source of inspiration. There's work to be done and it is plenty. We shall not loose ourselves in organisation and managerial deadlock. 
The Factory Must Grow.
