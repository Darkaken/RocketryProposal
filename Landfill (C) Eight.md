RE: [[Disposal]]

Could have a large multiblock along the lines of a "Landfill Management Machine" which takes in items and places landfill blocks in it structure. 
You can upgrade it with input items, like plastic eating bacteria, various materials to melt/ mix trash, and whatnot to allow for a practical explanation for how the landfill would empty over time. Dumping in more energy or making it bigger would allow it to handle more, obviously.
The only trade-off is that its obviously a very custom multi and you have to be pretty generous with the waste item to space conversion ratio for it to be practical.
Could require only items be inserted though, so things like ores must be macerated such that they are more space efficient, or something along those lines.

*Grammar has been adjusted.*
